# PedCoT-IJCAI24

This repository provides a description of the work accepted by IJCAI-2024: LLMs can Find Mathematical Reasoning Mistakes by Pedagogical
Chain-of-Thought.

## Data
To evaluate our proposed PedCoT, we collect two public datasets (named PRM800K and BIG-Bench Mistake) containing step-level correctness labels for mathematical problems with different difficulties.

The original [BIG-Bench Mistake dataset](https://github.com/WHGTyen/BIG-Bench-Mistake) consists 2,186 reasoning traces generated by PALM-2, encompassing five reasoning tasks derived from diverse domains. With an emphasis on empowering LLMs to identify reasoning errors within the realm of mathematics, we chose samples exclusively related to this field. In total, these samples encompass 1,506 reasoning steps across 300 answer traces. The selected samples are released [here](data/big-bench-mistakes-multistep_arithmetic.jsonl).

The original [PRM800K dataset](https://github.com/openai/prm800k) contains about 800,000 step-level labels over 75,000 solutions for math word problems in the MATH dataset. We randomly select a set of 300 pairs of problems and their affiliated reasoning answer traces from its test split, containing 85 correct traces and 3,736 reasoning steps in total from PRM800K dataset. The selected samples are released [here](data/sampled_prm800k_test_set.jsonl).
